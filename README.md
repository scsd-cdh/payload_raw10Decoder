 # Raw10 to JPG/PNG Image Conversion

This Python script converts Raw10 image data to RGB and saves it as a PNG or JPG image.
The original script in Rust was contributed by Ruben Sanchez.

# Usage

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TheFourthKaramazov/raw10Decoder

    ```

3. Run the script from your IDE or with:

    ```

4. Enter your file path when prompted for the Raw10 file you want to decode.

5. Note:
